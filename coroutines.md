task<T> -> could be used for lazy comutations, if that's not for async stuff
  
  Good links list: https://gist.github.com/MattPD/9b55db49537a90545a90447392ad3aeb

Disadvantages:
* RAII might be not doing what you expect
* Harder debugging
* Parts of coroutine executed on different threadsin 
* Captured variables not visible

REALLY GOOD step by step tutorial: https://kirit.com/How%20C%2B%2B%20coroutines%20work
--------------------------------


* Presentation:
 * show stack trace
 * currently no tooling for seeing stored structures by handle
